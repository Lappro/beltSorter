Summary how to make entity copy/paste settings by blueprint:

- spawn invisible requester-chest (different force -> not shown as item required but must be shown in blueprint!)
- use item icon "config"
- set request_slot to custom data
- inventory slots = 0

check timeout on ghost -> no more timeouts in the game?

     {
        type = "ghost-time-to-live",
        modifier = 60 * 60 * 30
      }
			
	on build beltSorter, check for requester chest ghost -> load settings and revive
